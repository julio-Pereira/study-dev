# Food Service Management System (FSMS) - Architecture Documentation

## System Overview
The Food Service Management System (FSMS) is designed to streamline restaurant operations, manage inventory, process orders, and provide analytical insights into business performance.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
The FSMS follows a microservices architecture with the following major components:

1. **User Interface (fs-user-interface)**
   - Web-based frontend for staff and management
   - Mobile application for customers and delivery personnel

2. **Backend Services (fs-services)**
   - Authentication & Authorization Service
   - Order Management Service
   - Inventory Management Service
   - Payment Processing Service
   - Analytics Service
   - Notification Service

3. **Data Storage**
   - Relational Database (PostgreSQL) for transactional data
   - NoSQL Database (MongoDB) for unstructured data
   - Redis for caching

4. **Integration Layer**
   - API Gateway for external service integration
   - Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for asynchronous communication

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- Framework: React.js
- State Management: Redux
- UI Components: Material-UI
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library

### Backend
- Language: Java (Spring Boot)
- API Documentation: Swagger
- Testing: JUnit, Mockito

### Infrastructure
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Deployment Architecture
The system will be deployed on AWS with the following services:
- EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- CloudFront for CDN
- CloudWatch for monitoring

## Security Architecture
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with JWT
- Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Data Encryption: In-transit (TLS/SSL) and at-rest
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling for stateless services
- Database sharding for high-volume data
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- CDN for static assets

## Disaster Recovery
- Regular automated backups
- Multi-region deployment
- Failover mechanisms
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 4 hours
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 1 hour

## Future Roadmap
- AI-powered inventory management
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with additional payment gateways
- Voice-enabled ordering system

## Data Flow Diagrams

### Order Processing Flow
1. Customer places order through UI
2. Order Service validates order
3. Inventory Service checks product availability
4. Payment Service processes payment
5. Order Service updates order status
6. Notification Service alerts restaurant and customer
7. Analytics Service records transaction data

## API Documentation
The comprehensive API documentation is maintained using Swagger and is available at `/api/docs` endpoint in the development environment.
